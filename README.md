# AP4A_project

This project is an IOT ecosystem simulator specialized in monitoring the air quality of workspaces. It was developed as part of the AP4A course.

## Project Overview

### Introduction

The AP4A project takes the form of an individual mini-project aimed at putting into practice the knowledge acquired during the course. This project also serves as a preview of the Java project and its expectations.
### Context

The project involves creating a simulator to model an IOT ecosystem specialized in monitoring the air quality of workspaces. This ecosystem includes a server communicating with various types of sensors distributed in the workspace, such as a temperature sensor, a humidity sensor, a light sensor, and a sound sensor. The information collected by these sensors can be stored as log files or shared in a console for later visualization.

## Features

- [ ] IOT ecosystem simulation
- [ ] Communication between the server and sensors
- [ ] Collection and storage of sensor data
- [ ] Visualization of data in a console

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ZenT0x/AP4A_project.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your_project`
3. Compile the project: `g++ -o main *.cpp`
4. Run the main program: `./main 0|1 0|1 0|1` (Enable Mainlogs, serverslogs, and sensorslogs)
